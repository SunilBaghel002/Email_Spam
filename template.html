      <p>Dear SIH Organizing Committee,</p>

      <p>I hope you are doing well.</p>

      <p>
        I am writing this email with deep concern and a heavy heart regarding
        the evaluation process of our project submitted under
        <strong>Problem Statement ID: {{PS_ID}}</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        It has come to my notice that many of the evaluators have been
        conducting separate “judgment and PPT checking” sessions for money.
        Unfortunately, it appears that many of the teams selected for the next
        round participated in those sessions. As participants who truly believe
        in the fair and transparent spirit of SIH, this situation feels very
        disheartening.
      </p>

      <p>
        To understand the matter better, I reviewed the results and reached out
        to one of the selected team leaders. After viewing their PPT, I noticed
        that their solution focuses on adjusting solar panels according to
        sunlight presence — an idea that is already quite common.
      </p>

            >In contrast, our project presents a unique and socially impactful
            approach:</strong
          >

            Developing
            <strong>energy-harvesting panels made from recycled plastic</strong>
            embedded with piezoelectric sensors.

          <li>
            Promotes
            <strong>sustainability by reducing plastic waste</strong> and
            creating green energy.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div>

      <p>
        Our team has worked tirelessly on this idea and has showcased it in
        <strong>four hackathons, winning three of them</strong>, where it was
        highly appreciated by judges and experts for its potential to create
        sustainable energy solutions from waste materials. We have invested our
        heart, creativity, and time into this project because we genuinely
        believe in its potential to make a positive impact on society.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am attaching our <strong>PPT</strong> and including the
        <strong>YouTube demo video link</strong> below for your kind review:

      </ul>

      <p>
        I sincerely request a <strong>re-evaluation of our idea</strong> so that
        our efforts can be assessed fairly and transparently. We deeply respect
        the values that SIH stands for and truly hope that merit and innovation
        will remain at the core of this esteemed platform.

        Thank you for taking the time to read my message and understand our
        concern. I look forward to your kind response.
